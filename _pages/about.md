I've been building websites since the 90s and coding in WordPress since 2006. Yes, you could call me an old fart and I won't be offended, I built my first site before CSS was invented. I haven't studied computer-science, it was always just a passion and a hobby. I am proud to say I started coding in BASIC on a 80286 machine and I'm still learning, evolving and growing both as a person and as a developer.

**Passionate about Web Accessibility & Sustainability.**

## Currently Working On:

I work full-time at [ThemeFusion](https://theme-fusion.com/) where I help build the Avada theme.

I am a representative of the [WordPress Themes Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) and also maintain the [Gridd WordPress Theme](https://w.org/themes/gridd) and other open-source [wplemon](https://wplemon.com) projects.

--------------------------

## Previous Work:

* **2014 - 2020**: Created and maintained the [Kirki Customizer Framework](https://w.org/plugins/kirki) (open-source)
* **2014 - 2016**: Created and maintained the Shoestrap Theme Framework & the Maera Framework (open-source)
* **2013 - 2015**: Support Staff at [Incsub](https://incsub.com/) ([wpmudev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/))

**Previous, non-IT work:**

* 2005 - 2009: Retail sales and store manager at The Mall, Athens.
* 2001 - 2005: Sound Engineer.
* All kinds of odd jobs, including - but not limited to - luthier, construction worker and others I'm not proud of.

----------------------

On my free time (if you can call it that) I work on my open-source projects and attending the [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/) 'cause I just like learning about Accessibility.

**EDIT, June 2020: Finished the courses, considering going for the IAAP WAS Certification.**

Born in 1981 in Greece - where I still live, my extra skills include crochet, wood carving, building guitar pedals and dabling with arduinos. Back in the day I studied sound engineering and I can play the guitar & bass. I used to play the clarinet and trumpet but it's been more than 20 years so don't expect a tune.

If you're oldfashioned you can [send me an email](mailto:aristath@gmail.com) though I can't guarantee a prompt response, it's a mess and things tend to get lost there.
